# am/place

am/place is an interactive game inspired by [r/place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place) built by amFOSS members for Hacktoberfest 2024. The way it works is that players submit PR's to this repository modifying the `pixel_update.json` file, the modifications to this file will reflect on pixels on the cavas.

`pixel_update.json`:
```json
[
  {
    "x": "145",
    "y": "0",
    "rgb": "#000000"
  }
]
